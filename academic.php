							<h3>Information Technology</h3>
							<p>
								<code>Information technology</code> is the use of computers and software to manage the information. Computers play an important role in information technology.  I.T.  is a technology to maximize the efficiency of production and improves the working efficiency. IT would be responsible for protecting the information, processing the information, transmitting the information and retrieving the information. Information Technology is often used to describe computers and computer networks, it actually includes all layers of all systems within an organization from the physical hardware to the operating systems, applications, databases, storage, servers and more.
							</p>
							<p>
								By using information technology we can have access to Latest news, Speak with People real time, Video Chatting, e-learning, e-Commerce and Social networking.
							</p>

							<h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Civil Engineering</h3>
							<p>
								<code>Civil Engineering</code> deals with construction. In a country like india where infrastructure and housing have a huge development potential , civil Engineers have an enormous scope. There are employment potential in both the public and private sector.
							</p>

							<h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Electronic Engineering</h3>
							<p>
								<code>Electronic engineering</code> is a form of engineering associated with electronic circuits, devices and the equipment and systems that use them. Electronic engineering utilities a variety of different types of electronic components from the more traditional analogue components through to digital electronic components, microprocessors and micro controllers as well as programmable logic devices. This means that electronic engineering can incorporate a large variety of different areas.  The field of electronic engineering includes a variety more specific electronic engineering fields including: analogue electronics, digital electronics, consumer electronics, embedded systems and power electronics.
							</p>
							<p>
								Electronic engineering fields :
							</p>
							<p>
								<code>When asking the question :</code> What is electronic Engineering, it is necessary to understand that there are many different fields and disciplines involved within the overall topic.Normally electronic engineers specialize in a particular field or area. This means that it is possible to select a particular field of interest.
							</p>

							<h3>Electrical Engineering</h3>
							<p>
								<code>Electrical engineering</code> is a professional engineering discipline that generally deals with the study and application of electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism. This field first became an identifiable occupation in the later half of the 19th century after commercialization of the electric telegraph, the telephone, and electric power distribution and use. Subsequently, broadcasting and recording media made electronics part of daily life. The invention of the transistor, and later the integrated circuit, brought down the cost of electronics to the point they can be used in almost any household object. Electrical engineering has now subdivided into a wide range of subfields including electronics, digital computers, computer engineering, power engineering, telecommunications, control systems, robotics, radio-frequency engineering, signal processing, instrumentation, and microelectronics. Many of these sub disciplines overlap with other engineering branches, spanning a huge number of specializations such as hardware engineering, power electronics, electromagnetic & waves, microwave engineering, nano-technology, electro chemistry, renewable energies, mechatronics, electrical materials science, and much more.
							</p>

							<h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Agriculture</h3>
							<p>
								<code>Agricultural engineering</code> is the branch of engineering that applies engineering science disciplines and technology practices to the efficient production and processing of food, feed, fiber and fuels. This course is made after merging the principles of animal biology, plant biology, mechanical, civil, electrical and chemical engineering.Agriculture Engineering is a technologically sophisticated field that offers bright career prospects and opportunity in any country around the world, and in various sectors.
							</p>

							<h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Mechanical Engineering</h3>
							<p>
								<code>What is mechanical engineering?</code>
							</p>
							<p>
								Simply speaking, mechanical engineering deals with anything that moves, from the tiniest micro-particle to the largest spacecraft, and even the human body—one of our most complex machines. It is the broadest of all engineering disciplines, and interdisciplinary work is key to our department’s success. Our flexible curriculum focuses on energy, materials and manufacturing of all sorts, as well as dynamics, robotics, design and controls.
							</p>
							<p>
								<code>What do mechanical engineers do?</code>
							</p>
							<p>
								It’s difficult to identify an aspect of our daily lives that hasn’t been touched by mechanical engineering. Mechanical engineers use their knowledge of materials, design and manufacturing to advance the world around us. They design and create everything from micro-sensors, medical devices, computers and car engines to robots, cook stoves, sports equipment and airplanes.
							</p>
							<p>
								<code>Where do mechanical engineers work?</code>
							</p>
							<p>
								Mechanical engineers are employed in nearly every kind of industry and business type, from small startups to Fortune 500 companies. They are involved with seeking new knowledge through research, creative design and development, and with the construction, control, management and sales of the devices and systems needed by society. Additionally, some mechanical engineers take their knowledge and apply it to non-traditional career pathways in medicine or law.
